# The Postcard
Who does not like postcards? This is one of your first exercises (if not the first) and it's fun and relatively easy :)

Let's create a postcard with HTML5 and CSS and then you can share it with your mom or with your other half, she/he is going to be proud! :)

Don't think too much about HTML semantics here, we want to focus on HTML structure and CSS classes.

## Instructions
